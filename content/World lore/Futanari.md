# Overview
Futanari is an over arching medical term used to refer to people affected by one of two gene conditions which result in an otherwise female body manifesting a male phallus and the ability to produce sperm under certain conditions. 

Due to the original discovery of the condition 3 different types were categorized using the physical manifestation. Though further discovery revealed type 1&2 are caused by the same condition. The framework remains in place due to the different medical needs of the patients.

## General needs:
There are two major traits that all futanari have in common:

- Enhanced sexual arousal
- Multi-functional gonads

All futanari, being that they have highly increased sexual nerve endings, and varying levels of raised hormones have higher levels of sex drive compared to an average individual. But it is *very important to recognize* that this does not mean they lose control of their faculties as much common wisdom purports. The levels are still very well within human ranges, simply enhanced to a degree that some accommodation should be made so they don't feel singled out when dealing with their needs. This is especially important when dealing with youth, everyone has memories of that period of their lives. So please extend your sympathies to these individuals who have it ever worse still.


Futanari only posses one set of gonads, though they are from 25%-50% larger. They do have an increase chance for a 3rd to appear, though it is not significant enough to be considered the norm.
Despite this futanari are capable of producing both eggs **and** sperm. This is possible due to the futanari gonad to change function when exposed to sexual hormones of the corresponding gender. Generally this process determined by the type of stimulation the individual receives most often. But can be affected by external factors such as diet, medications, illness, and intentional treatment. In any case the transitional phase can be from 1-4 weeks depending on how long its been since their last transition. During this period the individual will producing no sperm or egg, but an increased amount of hormones. As such this period can be very difficult mentally and physically, so medical leave may be required on a case by case basis.

## Types:
The different types of futanari all have different medical requirements, needs, and accommodation. Further info can be found at the links below.

# Origin:
These gene conditions are the result of medical malpractice in the mid 21st century. Before legal framework was established to cover such gene editing worldwide. Two separate groups attempted to genetically engineer humans with both sets of genitals. Though the names of these groups are lost to time, witnesses have come forward to attempt to explain their reasoning.
### Group 1:
The first group, a collection of sexual freedom extremists attempting to create an unified human race attempted to create the perfect human, capable of  procreation without the need of a second gender, thus ending the need for separate treatment of the sexes. As a result of their ambition, their attempts were focused on creating a single unified genital, by enlarging the clitoris into a fully functional phallus. 

They then made a major attempt to spread the gene by lacing medications intended for pregnant women with the gene therapy. They were soon discovered and though at the time the full extent of their deeds unknown, disbanded. Though not before an unknown number of women were exposed on the pacific islands and west coast of the Americas. It wasn't long before their attempt bore fruit, and the conditions of type 1&2 futanarism became apparent.
### Group 2:
The second group, a coalition composed of corrupt Chinese officers and remnants of the north korean government, attempted to create a sexual slave class of women to serve them. The trait meant as class signifier, but also to cater to the tastes of the project lead. 

To this end they focused on editing in a new sequence of RNA into the genome of test embryos intending on creating a separate genital. But no visible result ever came of it Some of the woman had heightened states of arousal and anomalies were visible on ovarian ultrasound, but overall the attempts were considered failures and the subjects scattered over the continent of asia to hide the location of the labs. It was not until a few generations later that their success was discovered.

 In their haste for results, they had inadvertently created a recessive gene, which only fully expressed upon both parents passing it on. Due to the dispersing of the subjects, and the need for male carriers to mature, the meddling was not visible to the public as the population of carriers increased. Until it reached critical mass and suddenly it was apparent across the globe as children were born with what are now recognized traits of type 3 futanarism
