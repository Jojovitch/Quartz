## Overview:
Type 3 [[futanari]] posses a full set of female genitalia, and just above the clitoris, rests the pseudo-phallus.

## Type specific concerns:
The phallus, being placed in addition to the standard genitals create a somewhat cramped pubic area. Because of this, the mons pubis applies significant pressure to the top base of the shaft, restricting return blood flow to the body.

As a result of the restriction, type 3 individuals will in most cases, find themselves at least halfway erect at all times unless specific action is taken against it. In extreme cases a compression sleeve may be issued, but for most cases somewhat tight underwear will suffice.

Additionally due to the restriction, during full arousal the penis will retain excessive amounts of blood, engorging it beyond a healthy capacity. It is therefor advised that should this occur the individual in question should relieve the arousal via direct penile stimulation. A focus on applying pressure from the tip to base should be taken to assist blood evacuate the phallus quickly.

If the situation is untreated for an extended period, the individual may begin to suffer from hype-phallus syndrome. Wherein the penis will semi-permanently enlarge in size and begin to become a hinderance in daily life, in addition to high blood pressure concerns. With long term compression sleeve treatment this may be reversed, but such treatment has negative side effects during puberty and must be delayed until puberty is deemed complete by a medical professional. For this reason it is imperative that communication of the serious nature of these practices to minors coming of age is of utmost importance.
