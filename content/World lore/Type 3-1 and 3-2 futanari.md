## Overview:
Due to the disparate origins of [[Type 1 Futanari|Type 1]]/[[Type 2 Futanari|2]] and [[Type 3 Futanari|Type 3]] futanari, it is possible, though extremely rare for someone to be born with both conditions. Even when both gene's are present, usually one takes a dominant role and suppresses the other. As a result only a handful of cases have been confirmed to date. When both gene's do express, the heightened levels of hormones in the body almost guarantee that it will express as type 3-2 and type 3-1 is only hypothetical at this time.

## Type specific concerns:
Type 3-1/2 individuals, in the majority of cases, posses an additional gonad. This 3rd gonad isn't functional in producing sperms or eggs, but does produce additional hormones. As a result they may suffer from even further heightened urges. Additionally, the body trends towards more masculine development. A majority of cases find this development uncomfortable/undesirable.  Recently, recommendations lean towards testosterone suppressing supplements in most cases, as .

The increase sexual urges may become an serious concern, and number of patients have reported  they don't fully trust themselves. We'll re-enforce that there is no clinical data to support this, and there's no evidence that any futanari are more sexually aggressive. However as a psychological aid, custom made chastity devices will be provided upon request. Patients have stated this makes them feel more in control, and as downside are minimal, it has become somewhat common in the small community. 1*

Puberty is usually very aggressive, and continues much later into life. What limited records exist show puberty tends to taper around 25-27. Historically, this is shown to become difficult to live with, and frequently requires surgical intervention once secondary sexual characteristics begin to effect daily life negatively. It is now recommended for puberty to be artificially halted once reasonable maturity has been achieved. Attempting to slow development however is advised against, as it may result in a resistance to the medication necessary to halt it later in life.
