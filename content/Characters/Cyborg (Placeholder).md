# Creation Notes:
Due to a serious car accident 5 years ago, she was left in serious medical condition. After a few days of hospital support it was determined that despite her brain being perfectly healthy, the damage to her spine and body was too great. Her condition would only worsen.

Upon hearing of the case, the head researcher of prothesis at the hospital proposed an experimental full body transplant. Due to her age and situation she was considered an optimal participant for the trail run. 

Though it took a few years to learn to utilize the neural interface fully as she adapted to the interface. Thanks to brain scan technology they were able to prepare a communication interface before the operation took place. Unexpectedly she was able to use this interface to connect online and continue her education and socialize with the wider world. 

This year is her return to the physical realm in earnest. Thanks to a new remote interface designed by the project lead, she's able to project her brain signals into an avatar body. Allowing her to stay in the safe observation of hospital staff, while for her, its as though she isn't there at all.

Due to the experimental nature of the project, full replacement bodies aren't available for her to use. Instead her avatar core attaches to a variety of limb prothesis. She has to change them yearly to simulate normal bodily growth. She does have a custom face unit that adapts at a more gradual rate made to match a simulation of her old body. The torso unit, originally a simple bare template for other prothesis to attach too, has since be retro-fit by [[Rina]] at [[Yuu-Ri Custom Electronics and Design Studio]]. Thanks to her personal experience with prothesis, and work from more erotic requests. She was able make her a torso that includes more detail and "personal use" abilities that the doctors overlooked.

She was assigned to the [[F.A. Class]] as [[Teachers Aid (placeholder)]] is working there and they have interacted before as part of [[Teachers Aid (placeholder)]]'s studies.
