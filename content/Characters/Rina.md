## Character Description:
---
- Rina is highly technically oriented, and loves to create mechanical and functional items.

- Has a hard time creating original ideas for herself, but excels at bringing others ideas into reality.

- Very quiet in most cases, but easily becomes overwhelming if a topic of interest comes up

- Formed a co-dependency towards [[Yuuna]] due to an extended hospital stay they shared earlier in their lives.

- If it's them, they're always together. Sleeping at each others house every night.

- When separated from [[Yuuna]], she becomes closed off to the world equipping her welding goggles and working on some small electronics project she carries with her. In this state, getting more than a simple yes or no out of her can be quite difficult.

- Rina and [[Yuuna]] are together well known creators under the combined artist name of "[[Yuu-Ri Custom Electronics and Design Studio|Yuu-Ri]]", and are frequently asked to make unique tools and items. Generally, only doing lewd works for close friends. Excellent at keeping confidences. 

- Rina is the production side of the team, creating the items that [[Yuuna]] conceptualizes.
## Physical Description:
---
- Missing her left arm due to a cancerous growth during early childhood. Cutting off all blood flow down her arm, resulting in an eventual amputation at the shoulder. Though the cancer was completely eradicated, she was left without the limb.

- Owing to her missing arm, she has a deep interest in the art of prosthesis, and has developed a functional arm for herself nearly indistinguishable from organic.

- Part of her prosthesis is a permanent implanted interface composing her shoulder, with the socket level with the armpit.

- Though she uses her standard prosthesis at most times to avoid the excess questions, she actually prefers to use a more functional multi use attachment in its place whenever she can get away with it. 

- All her arms include a digital link she's learned to use as a direct interface with compatible electronics, bypassing the need for the standard keyboard/mouse interface.

- Even When wearing her standard prosthesis, she keeps a small stash of tools in a compartment in the forearm. Simply tools such as: a screwdriver, a soldering iron, an adjustable wrench, and a quick makeup kit for touching up the arm's seams.

- She also has a more *lewd* attachment, which she is always changing to fit her mood and the mood of her partner.

- Short in stature due to her previously mentioned ailment stunting her growth.

- Her treatment also caused damage to her hair follicles, resulting in the total loss of her ability to grow new hair. Though she did receive treatment/transplant that allows her to grow hair on her head, it was deemed unnecessary to do so for the rest of her body in order to save her the stress during recovery. (Although if she wished she could do so at any time, she takes no real issue with it at the moment.)
