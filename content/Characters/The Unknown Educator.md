Head teacher of [[Name Pending Girls school]]'s [[F.A. Class]]. Proposed the class as a joke during a year end staff meeting. Upon approval from the principal he took this to mean his termination as he though the idea was absurd and never showed for class.
Other staff took this as embracing the classes concept in stride and applauded him for his bravery. The class performed surprisingly well, as separated from the negative influences in the rest of the classes, the students found themselves pursuing interests with much enthusiasm.

After a few years his name seemed to go missing from the books, this was taken as another deliberate action by the staff. And he became known as the Unknown Educator, and the class structure has begun to be replicated in other schools. Meanwhile he is hailed as a innovator and his pseudonym was awarded many awards.

He is aware of non of this and is working as a janitor for another school.
