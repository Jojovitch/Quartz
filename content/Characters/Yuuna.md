## Physical Description:
---
- Due to a cancerous growth during early childhood, she is quite frail. Though all the cancerous cells were destroyed successfully, she still has a weak constitution.

- The ailment also left her incredibly short, though almost a year older than Rina, she is still 3 cm shorter.

- Her hair and skin are almost snow white and smooth to the touch. Similar to Rina, her treatment damaged her hair follicles, but not to as extreme an extent, she has lost all color, though still dense, the hair itself is light to the extreme.  Her eyes are a shining sky blue and almost seem to sparkle with the intensity of her gaze.

- Wears lots of light clothing to cover her skin, as due to its pale nature it is prone to sunburn easily. Nothing too heavy if she can help it, she finds the weight tiresome.
